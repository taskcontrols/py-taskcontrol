Comparison
For comparison of different BSON type values, see the specified BSON comparison order.

$eq - Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
$gt - Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
$gte - Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
$in - Matches any of the values specified in an array.
$lt - Matches values that are less than a specified value.
$lte - Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
$ne - Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
$nin - Matches none of the values specified in an array.

Logical

$and - Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses.
$not - Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the query expression.
$nor - Joins query clauses with a logical NOR returns all documents that fail to match both clauses.
$or - Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause.

Element

$exists - Matches documents that have the specified field.
$type - Selects documents if a field is of the specified type.

Evaluation

$expr - Allows use of aggregation expressions within the query language.
$jsonSchema - Validate documents against the given JSON Schema.
$mod - Performs a modulo operation on the value of a field and selects documents with a specified result.
$regex - Selects documents where values match a specified regular expression.
$text - Performs text search.
$where - Matches documents that satisfy a JavaScript expression.

Geospatial

$geoIntersects - Selects geometries that intersect with a GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere index supports $geoIntersects.
$geoWithin - Selects geometries within a bounding GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $geoWithin.
$near - Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $near.
$nearSphere - Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $nearSphere.

Array

$all - Matches arrays that contain all elements specified in the query.
$elemMatch - Selects documents if element in the array field matches all the specified $elemMatch conditions.
$size - Selects documents if the array field is a specified size.

Bitwise

$bitsAllClear - Matches numeric or binary values in which a set of bit positions all have a value of 0.
$bitsAllSet - Matches numeric or binary values in which a set of bit positions all have a value of 1.
$bitsAnyClear - Matches numeric or binary values in which any bit from a set of bit positions has a value of 0.
$bitsAnySet - Matches numeric or binary values in which any bit from a set of bit positions has a value of 1.

Projection Operators

$ - Projects the first element in an array that matches the query condition.
$elemMatch - Projects the first element in an array that matches the specified $elemMatch condition.
$meta - Projects the document's score assigned during $text operation.
$slice - Limits the number of elements projected from an array. Supports skip and limit slices.

Miscellaneous Operators

$comment - Adds a comment to a query predicate.
$rand - Generates a random float between 0 and 1.
